# Power-BI-projects

This is a repository with some of my first Power BI projects.

The databases are fictitious or taken from sites like kaggle.

The cleaning, treatment and initial analysis work was done first in Excel.

The data modeling and visualization process was done in Power BI.

Some designs were created with Figma and imported into Power BI.
