# Power-BI-projects

🙍🏾‍♀️ Hello, my name is Jessica Garcia. I am a French teacher and I study data analysis autonomously.
This is a repository with some of my first Power BI projects.

✅ The databases are fictitious or taken from sites like kaggle.

✅ The cleaning, treatment and initial analysis work was done first in Excel.

✅ The data modeling and visualization process was done in Power BI.

✅ Some designs were created with Figma and imported into Power BI.
